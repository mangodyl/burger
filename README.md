## Using Big Kahuna Logger :bulb:

Life is so full of burgers that it can be real tough to remember what delicious bun stacks you've devoured.

This is where Big Kahuna Logger comes in, meaning you'll never repeat yourself if you don't have to.

Picture this: you're at a restaurant and your New Year's Resolution is something lame and non-commital like 'be adventurous'. Are you gonna get another cheeseburger? Or maybe you'll add bacon this time and think "whew, I'm really pushing the boat out!"...

__STOP__

You know you've already had that bacon cheeseburger, and look at that insane one they're calling "The Smokey Robinson" - two patties, smoked gouda, smoked bacon, smokey bbq sauce, and a dash of liquid smoke, all cooked over a maple-wood fire...

__DO IT__

It's this one. It's time. Break the shackles of mundanity, now weakened by lust, and step naked into this new dimension of burgers. Order this symbol of freedom, and as you take each bite I want you to thank Big Kahuna Logger for what it has done for you this day.

## Instructions :scroll:

Big Kahuna Logger is a no-frills app. Using it is simple:

1) Type the name of the burger you want to add in the text box, choose whether you've eaten it already or not, then hit Add Burger.

1) Your Burger Hit-List is for the burgers you really want to eat but haven't yet. Click 'Devour!' once you have.

1) The Devoured list is for the burgers you've eaten already. Hit delete if you want to forget one or if you made a mistake.

### Enjoy your burgers! :v:
